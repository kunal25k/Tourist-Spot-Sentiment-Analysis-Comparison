# Tourist-Spot-Sentiment-Analysis-Comparison
Comparative Study of Sentiment Expressed at Tourist Spots in Dubai and Pune

Tourism is one of the most important sources of economic activities in cities and a significant driver
of the economy for many. While it contributes to 20% of the GDP for the small emirate of Dubai in
the UAE, it contributes a minor fraction of 6.7% to the Indian GDP. It is crucial for governments to
assess the impact of tourism-investment in these locations have on people around them - both tourists
and residents. This raises the need to monitor the sentiment of visitors and residents both at tourist
spots for developed and developing tourism locations using social media data. The explosion of available
social media data allows for a more time-sensitive and geographically specific sentiment analysis than
ever before. In this project, we perform a spatio-temporal sentiment analysis of data from the microblogging website Twitter to assess the general sentiment of both residents and visitors around these
tourist destinations for the developed and developing (in the context of tourism) cities of Dubai and
Pune respectively. This comparative study intends to identify differences in the patterns of sentiment
distribution for both Dubai and Pune while also exploring any possible relationship between weather and
these patterns.
